# Probability and Statistics Final
Here you will find my youtube link to my video presentation, and all files necessary for my final project including Jupyter Notebook..

**Notes! Please Read!**
The youtube video is cut off slightly premature so please see the conclusion section on Jupyter Notebook.
Also, the intake_outcome combined data set was too large to upload to github, however will be included in the zip file uploaded to moodle.

Additionally, in the video I didn't get a chance to get deep into the point of the decision tree. Ultimately, each branch splits off into a decision of 'yes' or 'no' and each root node will indicate the ultimate decision of will the animal be adopted or not. This is what the "Class" represents. Mine consisitently led to "Class = No", meaning the factors really didnt have much of a impact between "Adopted = Yes" vs. "Adopted = No". In other words, none of the factors provided an indication on the outcome for that animal.

Also, when viewing the Jupyter Notebook in Github itself, the decision tree is relatively difficult to see. If you would like to see it in greater detail/larger, I sugges downloading the ipynb file and actually viewing it in Jupyter, or refer to my video. If there is any issues for what ever reason viewing on your computer, please do a quick 'pip install graphviz' in the terminal.
