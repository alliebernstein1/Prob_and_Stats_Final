Here you will find my youtube link to my video presentation, and all files necessary for my final project including Jupyter Notebook..

**Notes**
The youtube video is cut off slightly premature so please see the conclusion section on Jupyter Notebook.
Also, the intake_outcome combined data set was too large to upload to github, however will be included in the zip file uploaded to moodle.
